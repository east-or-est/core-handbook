# Automated Testing

This is an overview of running and writing tests for WordPress. Automated testing is running test cases where manual intervention is not required to run each one. This is usually in the form of writing test suites which have multiple test cases and a library and command line tool that runs the test suite or suites.

The test suites WordPress uses are PHPUnit for PHP and QUnit for JavaScript.

Execution is usually manual, from the developer choosing which suites on the command line to run, but this isnâ€™t required. The process could be automated and looked over from time to time to ensure that when the code changed, no problems were introduced.

For more information on getting started installing the test suites and running and writing tests, follow the links below:

Note: If writing a test requiring a YouTube or Vimeo URL/embed, please use the WP 5.0 release YouTube video and the official Vimeo test video:
