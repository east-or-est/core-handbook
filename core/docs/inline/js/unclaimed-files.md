# Unclaimed files

An up-to-date list of unclaimed files can be found in the [announcement post of the JS documentation initiative](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/01/31/js-docs-initiative-add-inline-docs-for-javascript/). If you wish to help with JS documentation, you can claim a file there by commenting on that post.
